# NPCScheduler
An algorithm for Time-Based NPC's in 3D games. Created for use in the Unity Engine and later adapted to Godot 4.1, however could easily be adapted for other workflows.

## How Does it Work?
The algorithm takes in a few variables, such as: current time, the time the pathing should start, the time the pathing should finish, as well as the points to follow.
The algorithm itself can be demonstrated using this piecewise function:

Let:
```
    P = path points (p_1, p_2, ..., p_n)
    T = start and end times (t_start, t_end)
    t = the specified time
    L = total line length
    n = total number of points in P
    d = L/n
    t' = (t - t_start) / (t_end - t_start)
    l = L * t'
```
We're looking for a point q in the path at time t. The formula is as follows:
```
For all i âˆˆ {0, 1, ..., n-2}:

    If d * (i + 1) <= l < d * (i + 2), then
        q = p_{i+1} + (p_{i+2} - p_{i+1}) * ((l - d * (i + 1)) / (d * (i + 2) - d * (i + 1)))
```
This is a piecewise function that defines the point q for all possible segments in the path. This function covers all possible values of l (and therefore t). It works by determining which segment the NPC is on at time t and then linearly interpolating between the endpoints of that segment to find the exact position of the NPC.

## How Can I Implement This Into My Own Project?

### Unity

To implement this into a Unity project, you simply need to feed the code a changing time variable (which is referenced in ScheduledNPC.cs as GM.currentTime) as well as an NPCPath instance that contains 3-Dimensional points in your scene.

### Godot

The Godot section of this repository is newer a bit more adaptable than the Unity section. If there is any confusion in hierarchy you can refer to the image below or the example project included in the repository.

To begin, just create a plain Node for our NPC. There's two branches of this Node in Godot, the NPC and it's path. I will first explain the path.

Firstly, you will want to create a child of our NPC node and attach the NPCPathVisualizer.cs script to it. Then create a child node of this node, as it will store all of the NPC path points. This parent node will need to be assigned in NPCPathVisualizer.cs.

*Note: this section is specifically for being able to visualize the NPC path which is more complicated than unity. If you just case about functionality you can skip this and comment it out of the code.

Next, you want to make use of the J_Debug.cs node found [here](https://github.com/JakeButf/Godot3Debugger). This node needs to be a child of your NPC Path node. This will allow NPCPathVisualizer.cs to draw reference lines of the NPC's path.

Then you can simply create and place Node3D children of the NPCPath node we assigned earlier to map out your path.
